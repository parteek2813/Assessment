### Testing Plan for Todo Application

#### Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the Todo application, detailing the types of tests and specific test cases for each component. The goal is to ensure reliability, functionality, and user interface consistency across the application.

#### Testing Tools
- **Jest**: For unit and snapshot testing.
- **React Testing Library**: For integration and user interaction testing.

#### Components Testing Plan

##### 1. Header
- **Type of Tests**: Unit tests, Snapshot tests.
- **Test Cases**:
  - Verify that the Header component renders correctly.
  - Ensure that the Header contains the correct text (e.g., "Todo List").
  - Snapshot test to ensure no unexpected changes in the Header layout.

##### 2. Footer
- **Type of Tests**: Unit tests, Snapshot tests.
- **Test Cases**:
  - Check if the Footer component renders without crashing.
  - Validate that the Footer displays any required information or links correctly.
  - Snapshot test to confirm the Footer's appearance remains consistent.

##### 3. Input
- **Type of Tests**: Unit tests, Integration tests.
- **Test Cases**:
  - Ensure the Input component renders a text input and submit button.
  - Test input validation for empty submissions.
  - Verify that typing into the input changes its value.
  - Check if clicking the submit button adds a new todo item (integration with the `Item` component).

##### 4. Item
- **Type of Tests**: Unit tests, Integration tests.
- **Test Cases**:
  - Confirm that the Item component displays the todo text correctly.
  - Test the "complete" button functionality: clicking it should mark the item as completed.
  - Test the "delete" button functionality: clicking it should remove the item.
  - Integration test with the `Main` component to ensure it updates the list correctly upon item addition, completion, or deletion.

##### 5. Main
- **Type of Tests**: Integration tests, User interaction tests.
- **Test Cases**:
  - Verify that the Main component renders all todo items correctly.
  - Ensure that adding a new item through the `Input` component updates the list.
  - Test completing and deleting items updates the list appropriately.
  - Check filtering functionality (if implemented), such as viewing all, completed, or active todos.

##### 6. App
- **Type of Tests**: Integration tests, End-to-end tests.
- **Test Cases**:
  - Ensure that the App component integrates the Header, Footer, Input, Item, and Main components correctly.
  - Test the overall user flow: adding a new item, marking it as complete, and deleting it.
  - Verify that the application's state is managed correctly across different user interactions.

#### Execution Plan
- Implement tests starting from unit tests for individual components to integration and end-to-end tests.

#### Conclusion
This testing plan provides a structured approach to ensure each component of the Todo application functions correctly and integrates seamlessly with the rest of the application. By following this plan, we aim to achieve a high-quality, reliable, and user-friendly application.
